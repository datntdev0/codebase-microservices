# Microservice Codebase Requirements

As a solo developer and software architect, I want to create my codebase and boilerplate of the microservice solution. Then any later project need to build on microservice architecture, I can use that boilerplate to kick off project fastly.

There is no standardized, reusable boilerplate within my career path and development workflow that enables fast, consistent, and scalable microservice project initialization. Each new project requires manual setup of core infrastructure.

### Goal: To design and maintain a robust, extensible microservice boilerplate codebase that
- Provides a ready-to-use foundation for new microservice projects
- Includes essential components like authorization, communication, monitoring,â€¦
- Enables rapid project kickoff with minimal configuration
- Supports testing, CI/CD, and containerization out of the box
- Offers clear documentation and usage guideline

### Scopes: This boilerplate will serve as the architectural backbone for future projects requiring microservices
- Boilerplate template for distributed applications with .NET ecosystem
- Boilerplate template of Angular for the single page application frontend
- Apply the most modern and famous frameworks, technologies
- Cover most common concerns, problems, aspects in microservice architecture

### Features:
- Software as a Service and multi-tenancy system
- Payment method to register tenancy subscription
- Single-sign-on along with external identity provider
- Realtime in-app notification, email and text notification
- Themed-UI and and customizable localization configuration

### Technical aspects:
- Modular architecture is designed with DDD, EDD, TDD
- .NET Aspire as the cloud-native tech stack for building microservice with .NET
- Authentication and authorization is implemented with OpenIddict library
- Communication including internal and external supported by Yarp and gRPC
- Use Kafka to have native supports for most of use cases in Event-Driven Archiecture
- Monitor and observe system with dashboard and telemetry services
- Use Azure Cloud services and GitHub to deploy system economically
- Continuous Integration with automated testing and quality scanning
