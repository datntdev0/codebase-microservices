# Version control with GitHub branching

This document outlines the branching strategy and workflow for this repository.


### Primary Branches

- **main**: Represents the production code.
- **develop**: Contains active development and new features.
- **feature/\***: Used for developing new features.
- **hotfix/\***: Created from the latest `main` branch to resolve urgent issues.

### New Feature Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**  
   - Branch off `develop` as `feature/<feature-name>`.
2. **Merge feature branch into develop**  
   - Open a merge request from `feature/<feature-name>` to `develop`.
   - Conduct code review and collaborate with colleagues.
   - Squash and merge commits into a single commit.
3. **Release new version (develop â†’ main)**  
   - Open a merge request from `develop` to `main` with title: `Release vX.Y.Z: merge 'develop' branch`.
   - Code review and deploy to staging.
   - Merge with merge commit into `main`.
   - Rebase `main` back into `develop` locally and push to origin.

### Hotfix Urgent Issue Workflow

1. **Create a hotfix branch**  
   - Branch off `main` as `hotfix/<issue-name>`.
2. **Merge hotfix branch into main**  
   - Open a merge request from `hotfix/<issue-name>` to `main` with title: `Release vX.Y.Z: merge 'hotfix' branch`.
   - Code review and deploy to staging.
   - Merge with merge commit into `main`.
   - Rebase `main` back into `develop` locally and push to origin.
