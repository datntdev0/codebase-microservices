# Microservice Software Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of a robust, extensible microservice boilerplate designed for distributed applications with the .NET ecosystem and Angular SPA frontend. The boilerplate aims to accelerate project initiation, enforce best practices, and cover common architectural concerns, serving as the foundation for scalable Software-as-a-Service solutions.

### Objectives
- Rapid Project Kickoff: Minimize configuration and manual setup for new microservice projects.
- Extensibility: Enable easy addition of new services and features.
- Consistency: Apply proven patterns for maintainable, scalable solutions.
- Modern Technology Stack: Leverage industry-leading frameworks and cloud services.
- Out-of-the-Box Operations: Integrate testing, CI/CD, monitoring, and documentation.

### Core Architectural Patterns

#### 1. **Modular Microservices**
- Each business capability is encapsulated in a dedicated service.
- Follows DDD: Bounded Contexts and Aggregates per module.
- Follows EDD: Event Sourcing and CQRS where applicable.
- Follows TDD: Unit, Integration, and End-to-End tests for each service.
- Clean separation of infrastructure, domain, and application layers.

#### 2. **API Gateway**
- Centralized entry point for all client apps.
- Request routing via YARP (Reverse Proxy).
- Supports HTTP REST and gRPC for service-to-service communication.

#### 3. **Authentication & Authorization**
- OpenIddict provides OIDC flows, external identity provider integration (Azure AD, Google, etc.).
- Single Sign-On (SSO) across tenants and applications.
- Role, permission, and policy-based access control.

#### 4. **Multi-Tenancy & SaaS**
- Tenant context propagation via HTTP headers and claims.
- Data isolation: schema-per-tenant, partitioning, or row-level security (configurable).
- Subscription management, payment integration for tenant lifecycle.

#### 5. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- Kafka for asynchronous service communication, domain events, and integration events.

#### 6. **Notification System**
- SignalR for in-app push notifications (websocket).
- Pluggable email/SMS providers for external messaging.
- Notification templates and localization.

#### 7. **Observability & Monitoring**
- Aspire dashboards for health, metrics, and traces.
- Distributed tracing and logging (OpenTelemetry, Serilog).
- Integration with Grafana, Azure Monitor.

#### 8. **Testing & CI/CD**
- TDD-first approach: xUnit/NUnit for services, Cypress/Playwright for frontend.
- Automated code quality and security scans (SonarQube, Snyk).
- GitHub Actions for build, test, deploy pipelines.
- Containerization via Docker, Azure deployments via IaC.

### Extensibility Guidelines

- **Add New Service:** Scaffold via boilerplate template, register with gateway, configure event topics.
- **Integrate Provider:** Use pluggable interface adapters (payment, notification, auth).
- **Customize Frontend:** Theming and localization via Angular modules and configuration.
- **Extend Domain Logic:** DDD aggregates, domain events, and service boundaries.

### Documentation & Developer Experience

- **Getting Started:** Step-by-step guide to bootstrap new projects.
- **Usage Examples:** End-to-end workflow samples (tenant registration, payment, notification).
- **API Reference:** OpenAPI specs, gRPC proto files, event contracts.
- **Best Practices:** DDD, EDD, TDD, modularization, cloud-native deployment.
- **Troubleshooting:** Common pitfalls, debugging, upgrade paths.

### Security Considerations

- Strong authentication flows, secure token management.
- Internal service communication over TLS.
- Data protection, secrets management via Azure Key Vault/GitHub Secrets.
- Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD.

### Cloud & Deployment Strategy

- **Azure First:** Native integration with Azure services (AD, Storage, SQL, Service Bus).
- **Container-first:** All components are containerized, ready for Kubernetes or Azure Container Apps.
- **Cost Optimization:** Use serverless options where possible, scale services independently.
- **DevOps:** GitHub Actions for full pipeline automation.

### Future Enhancements

- Support for additional frontend frameworks (React, Blazor).
- Pluggable AI services (recommendation, analytics).
- Multi-cloud deployment options.
- Advanced tenancy features (custom domains, per-tenant configuration).
