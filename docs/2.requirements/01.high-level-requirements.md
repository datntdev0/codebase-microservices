# Microservice Codebase Requirements

**Project Vision Statement:** To empower development teams to launch enterprise-grade, multi-tenant SaaS products in days rather than months by providing a standardized, reusable microservice boilerplate that enables teams to initialize production-ready SaaS projects, with built-in multi-tenancy, authorization, real-time notifications, and other common enterprise-grade features.

### Business Direction:
- Provides a ready-to-use foundation for new microservice projects.
- Includes essential components like authorization, communication, monitoring,…
- Supports fundamental operations in software development lifecycle.
- Enables rapid project kickoff with minimal configuration.
- Offers clear documentation and usage guideline.

### Scopes Boundaries:
- IN: Boilerplate including infrastructure, features, and marterials.
- OUT: Domain-specific business logic and features.

### Funtional Requirements:

#### FR001: Multi-tenancy - Support multiple tenants with isolated data and configurations.
#### FR002: Authentication - Implement secure user authentication mechanisms.
#### FR003: Authorization - Role-based and policy-based access control for resources.
#### FR004: Notifications - Real-time notifications via WebSocket and email services.
#### FR005: Localization - Support multiple languages and regional settings.
#### FR006: Administration - Monitoring and managing system for administrators.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

Category | Requirement Specification
---------|-------------------------
Performance | - System should respond to user requests within 300ms under normal load.<br>- System should handle at least 1,000 requests per second per instance.<br>- Web frontend performance should pass Lighthouse 90+ performance scores.
Scalability | - Autoscaling enabled for all services based on CPU/Memory usage.<br>- Zero-loss requests during scaling events.
Security | - OWASP Top 10 Compliance by using Code Security Scanners.<br>- Data should be encrypted in transit and at rest; comply with relevant regulations.<br>- Integrate secret management solutions for sensitive data.
Reliability | - System should have 99.9% uptime and under 0.1% error rate.<br>- Implement health check public site for all services.<br>- Automated backups and disaster recovery plans in place.
Observability | - System should have 100% traceability for requests across services.<br>- Centralized logging and monitoring with alerting for critical issues.<br>- Log retention policy of at least 30 days.

### System Requirements:

#### SR001: Architectural Principles

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Encapsulate business logic in rich Domain Models; use Bounded Contexts to define microservice boundaries.
- **Event-Driven Design (EDD):** Use Kafka as the "source of truth" for cross-service state changes, ensuring loose coupling and high availability.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** The boilerplate includes pre-configured unit, integration, and "Aspire-based" end-to-end test projects
- **Microservice Architecture:** Each microservice is independently deployable, scalable, and maintainable, communicating via well-defined APIs and messaging patterns.
- **Modularity and SOLID:** The codebase follows SOLID principles to ensure high cohesion and low coupling, facilitating easier maintenance and extensibility.

#### SR002: Technology Stack

Category | Technology & Description
---------|--------------------------------------
Database | **SQL Server & Entity Framework Core**<br>A relational database management system for structured data storage and retrieval.
Database | **MongoDB & Entity Framework Core**<br>A NoSQL database for flexible, schema-less data storage.
Backend | **.NET Aspire with ASP.NET Core**<br>A microservice framework built on .NET, providing essential features for building scalable and maintainable microservices.
Frontend | **Angular**<br>A TypeScript-based front-end web application framework for building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs).
API Gateway | **Yarp**<br>A reverse proxy and load balancer for routing requests to microservices.
Service Communicate | **gRPC and/or HTTP**<br>A high-performance, open-source universal RPC framework for inter-service communication.
Message Broker | **Apache Kafka**<br>A distributed event streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.
Observability | **Prometheus & Grafana**<br>Tools for monitoring and visualizing system metrics and performance.
Deployment | **GitHub Actions & Docker**<br>CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated builds, tests, and deployments; Docker for containerization of microservices.
