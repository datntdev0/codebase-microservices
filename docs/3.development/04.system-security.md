# Microservices System Security

This document details the security architecture and best practices implemented in the microservices boilerplate. It covers authentication, authorization, data protection, secure communication, and compliance considerations to ensure robust security across all services.

## Objectives

- Comprehensive Security: Implement multi-layered security measures to protect data and services.
- Best Practices: Follow industry standards and best practices for application security.

## Detailed specifications

### 1. Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Configured at the API Gateway level to restrict resource access to trusted domains.
- Configured at the Identity Service to allow only known client applications.
- Ignored the CORS policy for inner service-to-service communication within the trusted network.
- The CORS configuration is defined in the `appsettings.{Environment}.json` of the API Gateway and Identity Service.
